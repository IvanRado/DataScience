    "Analysing the two datasets we see two very different landscapes. In the Apple Store, a majority of the free apps are actually games (~58.14%), followed far behind by entertainment at 7.89%. Apps focused on more practical matters, such as education, productivity or health and fitness seem to take up a much smaller slice of the pie. The Google Play Store has a much different distribution, with the Family genre dominating, but at only 18.9%. Further investigation reveals that about ~60% of apps here are in fact games for kids, but this nonetheless leaves games at about 20% of the app market as opposed to the 58.14% of the Apple Store.\n",

    "Overall the marketplace on the Apple Store seems very geared towards games and entertainment while the Google Play marketplace seems like it has a much greater balance between entertainment and practical apps. Looking at the Genres column, we see a much more granular breakdown of the data; while the relation between this and the Category column is not precisely defined we will be working with the Genre column for a more big picture overview.\n",

This data is readily available in the Google Play data set but is missing from the Apple Store one. To work around this, we can use the number of total reviews that an app has instead, as we can safely assume that an app has been downloaded at least once by a user if it has been reviewed by them."

To stand out we may include novel features such as daily quotes from the book, an audio version of the book, quizzes on the book, a forum where people can discuss the book, etc."
